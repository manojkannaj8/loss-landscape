## Loss Landscape Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization of neural network **loss landscapes** and compares how different optimization algorithms navigate the parameter space during training.

The goal is to help understand **how optimizers like SGD, RMSProp, and Adam move across the loss surface** while minimizing the training error.

The system visualizes:

* 3D loss landscape of model parameters
* Optimization trajectories
* Decision boundaries in feature space
* Convergence diagnostics (loss and gradient norms)

This project is designed as an **educational tool for understanding neural network optimization dynamics**.

## Key Concepts

### Loss Landscape

The **loss landscape** represents how the model's error changes with respect to its parameters.

* High regions → high error
* Low valleys → optimal solutions

Training a neural network is equivalent to **finding the lowest point in this landscape**.

---

### Optimizers

Optimizers determine how the neural network updates its parameters during training.

This project compares three widely used optimizers:

* **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**
  Takes fixed steps along the gradient direction.

* **RMSProp**
  Adapts the learning rate based on recent gradient magnitudes.

* **Adam**
  Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster convergence.

## Visualizations

### 1. 3D Parameter Surface

Displays the **loss surface** of the neural network projected onto two principal directions in parameter space.

The optimization path is shown to illustrate how the model moves toward the minimum loss.

---

### 2. Optimization Trajectory (Contour Plot)

A top-down contour view of the loss landscape showing:

* Starting point of optimization
* Path taken by the optimizer
* Location of the optimal minimum

---

### 3. Decision Boundary (Feature Space)

Shows how the trained neural network separates two classes in feature space.

* Red points → Class 0
* Blue points → Class 1

The background color indicates the predicted class regions.

---

### 4. Convergence Diagnostics

Training behavior is monitored through:

* **Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss vs Epochs**
* **Gradient Norm vs Epochs**

These graphs help analyze training stability and optimizer performance.
